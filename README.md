# Background
With the goal of analyzing the job market for business analyst positions further, this project provides a review of some of the top-paying and in-demand skills, jobs, and how those intersect.

Data hails from Luke Barousse's SQL Course. It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills within the data and engineering field.

## The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?

2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?

3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?

4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?

5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?
