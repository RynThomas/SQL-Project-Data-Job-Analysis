# Background
With the goal of analyzing the job market for business analyst positions further, this project provides a review of some of the top-paying and in-demand skills, jobs, and how those intersect.

Data hails from Luke Barousse's [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills within the data and engineering field.

The SQL queries leveraged for the analysis can be found at [project_sql](https://github.com/RynThomas/SQL-Project-Data-Job-Analysis/tree/main/project_sql)

## The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?

2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?

3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?

4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?

5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?
